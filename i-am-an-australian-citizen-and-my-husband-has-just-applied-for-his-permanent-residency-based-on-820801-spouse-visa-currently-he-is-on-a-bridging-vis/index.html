    <title>I am an Australian Citizen and my husband has just applied for his permanent residency based on 820/801 spouse visa. Currently he is on a Bridging Visa A that will take him towards the 820 visa [in a couple of months] and then the 801. We would like to apply for a home loan with 5% deposit if we can as we would like to start building a new home shortly. It will also be our first home and we do qualify for FHOG. Would it be possible to secure a home loan? &middot; Loans101</title>
