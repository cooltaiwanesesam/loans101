<meta property="og:description" content="It sounds to me like you need a review of your financial circumstances to not only understand your borrowing power, but to also understand if a loan of this size will place you under financial distress. With 2 dependants, one being an infant, it is extremely important that you understand what loan amount you can afford, not necessary just what loan you can qualify for.

		<p> <p>It sounds to me like you need a review of your financial circumstances to not only understand your borrowing power, but to also understand if a loan of this size will place you under financial distress. With 2 dependants, one being an infant, it is extremely important that you understand what loan amount you can afford, not necessary just what loan you can qualify for. With the Loan Value Ratio (LVR) you are looking at, you will likely be subject to Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) which will add to the total cost of your loan. While you are a first home buyer and possibly eligible for both the first home owner grant (FHOG) and the subsequent stamp duty concessions, there are also other peripheral costs associated with purchasing a house and establishing a loan that you need to understand to make an informed decision. I am happy to assist you with assessing your requirements, though I cannot guarantee I will secure you a loan. Sometimes the best thing we brokers can do for our clients is to assist you in understanding what is viable and what is not, and being willing to work with you over the long term to achieve your dreams of home ownership. Feel free to contact me anytime for a confidential and obligation free discussion.</p>
