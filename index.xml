      <description>Buying a first home as an investment can have long term benefits and help put young Australians in a better financial position for the following reasons:
You can continue living at home and get into the property market sooner. The rental income can be used to help with the loan repayments and any savings can be put in an offset account to reduce interest on the loan.
There are a wider range of properties to choose from.</description>
