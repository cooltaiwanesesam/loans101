      <description>We are happy to help people with bad credit. There are definitely lenders in the non conforming space who specialise in this area. The loan product and interest rates will depend on the type of &amp;ldquo;bad credit&amp;rdquo;, such as missed repayments, defaults or a high number credit enquiries. Based on this, we can match the most appropriate lender to your situation.</description>

      <description>Based on the information you have provided there are a number of options that suit the criteria you have listed above. For a 5 year fixed rate with an offset account you could be looking at interest rates of about 4.19% right through to 4.79%. Some of these banks offer 100% offset accounts on their fixed rate loans and some will offer a shaded offset account, say around 50% to 70% offset.</description>

      <description>Great Question - You have the 5% genuine savings for the land and Im wondering if the gift has been in your account for &amp;gt; 3 months - if so then this might make up the balance of the house and land 5% needed. If you are looking to build asap - the rent or board you are currently paying is not included in servicing if both loans are put in at the same time.</description>

      <description>Happy to assist. There are many variables at the moment when it comes to investment lending e.g. interest only versus principal + interest, how much deposit you have . Just a couple of things that will impact the interest rate as all lenders have different requirements. Contact me through my profile and we can chat then.</description>

      <title>I am looking at buying a block of land and subdividing into 2. Cost of subdivision will be about $10,000. Land will be $95-100k. The land will be worth about $80k per block once divided. I am looking at building 2 house ( 1 on each block ) which will cone in around $200k per house. Once complet the houses will be worth about $360k each. Interested in a loan that gives me maximum leverage as I have another house I am going to start in before this. I owe about $97000k on the land which is valued by ANZ at $160k. The house build will be $330k whilst an agent has valued the finished home at $580k-$630k</title>

      <description>We can certainly assist in this type of project. Of course, the amount you can borrow will depend on your current financial position and the structure of ownership of these properties. You may also need to consider the taxation implications when subdividing blocks. Would love to have a chat to you about your situation so feel free to contact me through my profile.</description>

      <title>I am planning to buy land from a developer estate and then get a separate builder to construct the house. My plan is to start building as soon as the land gets titled. I am wondering which loans I can apply for. I am looking for a good rate.</title>

      <description>This type of purchase would fall under a construction loan and is usually financed in two steps: buying the land then building the house. The loans can be arranged separately, but are generally bundled together for approval. The purchase of the land occurs as a standard mortgage. Then the building of the house operates as a construction loan where you can draw-down on an agreed amount to pay for each stage.</description>

      <description>Assuming your transaction has been structured appropriately (bare trust considerations), there are many factors (some below) to consider with SMSF lending. There are a limited number of options offering up to 80% LVR meaning that your SMSF will need to contribute funds representing at least 20% of the valuation on completion, which in itself could pose a problem as valuations may come in less than contract price. There may also be liquidity requirements meaning that the SMSF must have sufficient cash assets (post-completion) as a buffer.</description>

      <description>There are numerous lenders that can provide unsecured finance within 24-48 hours. I would suggest that you are best to book an appointment with a broker to undertake a review of your financial circumstances. You may have more options available to you than you are currently aware of, including unlocking equity from your home with an up-to-date valuation, consolidating debt and accessing existing lines of credit, along with many other options that include exploring the wide variety of competitive personal loan products on the market.</description>

      <title>I am a current home owner with a mortgage of $202,000. I am looking at re-financing my mortgage with lower repayments but would also like to burrow extra for minor house renovations. I don&#39;t have any other loans. I currently have a personal credit card with the credit limit of $9,000 (at the moment, my credit card debt is $500 as I don&#39;t really like using it unless it is for emergencies). I would like a loan that allows me to make extra repayments and have the ability to redraw if needed. I have been in my current job for 11months (started Oct 16) but can provide all necessary past financial documents if required. Please advise what the best option might be.</title>

      <description>We would be very happy to assist you with refinancing to reduce your repayments and at the same access some equity for some home improvements. As a general rule of thumb, if you have had your current loan for more than 2 years, then it is likely that you will be able to refinance at a better rate and access some loan features such as a line of credit and a redraw facility.</description>

      <description>Your lending options are unfortunately limited with a co-borrower that has an undischarged bankruptcy. You really require the assistance of a broker who specialises in credit impaired finance. Not all brokers are specialists in this area so choose someone who declares this speciality, particularly if your loan requirements are time sensitive. Good luck and I hope you achieve your dream home ownership!</description>

      <title>I am interested in a home &amp; land package for 460,000 and can put in 40,000 deposit. So looking for 420,000 home loan. Gross Annual Income 84,000. First Time Home Buyer with no debts/no credit cards/no other loans. Two Dependents (Wife and Infant). Can I afford this property considering my borrowing power and Can I get less than 4.0% home loan interest rate?</title>

      <description>It sounds to me like you need a review of your financial circumstances to not only understand your borrowing power, but to also understand if a loan of this size will place you under financial distress. With 2 dependants, one being an infant, it is extremely important that you understand what loan amount you can afford, not necessary just what loan you can qualify for. With the Loan Value Ratio (LVR) you are looking at, you will likely be subject to Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) which will add to the total cost of your loan.</description>

      <title>I am looking at a block of flats to buy 4 of them. Is there a way that the seller can provide the deposit for example if the price is $270,000 have a price of $295,000 on the contract and him put up the $25k. Or any other way without him putting up the $25k upfront?</title>

      <description>Are you saying you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put in a deposit or you don&amp;rsquo;t actually have any funds to put towards a deposit? Any lender is going to want to see that you have funds to complete the purchase, a deposit bond can assist if you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the funds right now but will have the funds prior to settlement, e.g using equity from another property via refinance/equity release.</description>

      <description>Firstly, congratulations on embarking on the home loan journey. It is a very exciting time but I understand that issue of a default can be stressful. A small default like you describe won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stop you from getting a home loan approved, but there are things you can do to resolve it - as it is better to go in with a clean slate. Creditors will remove defaults if you can demonstrate they are wrong or you can make arrangements with them to pay it off.</description>

      <title>I have a home loan with CBA but I am not on the title - my mother is on the title as well as the loan. She is a pensioner and I have always been paying the loan. I am finding it quite difficult to refinance as all banks need me to be on the title. I don&#39;t want to be on the title - just want to refinance - are there any lenders that would help me? </title>

      <description>This is indeed possible if you are happy to go jointly on the loan with your mother. You can still remain off the title. Unfortunately, there is no other way you will be able to refinance for her if you remain off the loan. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re a busy man I see with 5 kids so good on you. Just to answer your question, it&amp;rsquo;s possible but you will need a really clean credit history as any loan you might take out will have to be approved by a Mortgage Insurer even after the lender says they will look at it. If you have a good rental payment history that helps and can be counted as genuine savings with certain lenders.</description>

      <description>Equity in an international asset is not acceptable security for Australian lenders. However, another effective means of freeing up funds to reduce or eliminate LMI is a ground approach to your overall financial situation. By taking a wholistic approach to your financial requirements and delving deeper into your circumstances, we can ensure that all facets of your financial situation are performing optimally. If you are servicing debts such as cars, credit cards, personal loans that affect your ability to save effectively and efficiently, a simple financial health check could provide you with the means to better service your loan, save a greater deposit and place you in better overall financial position prior to applying for a home loan.</description>

      <description>I assume that you are operating under the professional advice of your accountant or lawyer given you are looking to structure your loan under a trust. You most certainly need the assistance of a broker who can effectively liaise with your accountant or lawyer to ascertain the most appropriate product for your specific needs, goals and circumstances. Most brokers can secure you a competitive interest rate on your loan, however I suggest you find one that will delve a little deeper into your situation to ensure you are recommended a loan that provides you with the best value rather the lowest rate.</description>

      <description>The right investment home loan really depends on your particular financial goals. There are many different borrowing options and strategies available. Your investment loan should match your long-term financial goals and your broker should focus on maximising your borrowing power to achieve your investment goals faster. Most brokers can secure you a competitive interest rate on your loan, however I suggest you find one that will delve a little deeper into your situation to ensure you are recommended a loan that provides you with the best value rather than just the lowest rate.</description>

      <description>Most Lo Doc are maxed out at 80% - indicative rates 5.59% secured by owner occupied property and 5.59% investment. There are 90% loans - would be 6.5% +. Your accountant would need to sign off on the required income. For example -= to service requires income $80k if your single and with no other loans or credit cards - $86k with $10k credit card.

Current value of the property is in the order of $580 - $600k. We have had trouble refinancing as the serviceability calculator takes into account debt on principal &amp; Interest payments at a rate of %7.25. When our current debt repayments are interest only repayments at %4.19.</title>

      <description>I am guessing that your situation has changed since you first took out the loan. Unfortunately I think you are going to struggle to refinance if you are not able to service the debt according the lenders calculators. As part of responsible lending obligations both mortgage brokers and lenders need to ensure that you can manage repayments should interest rates rise. This is why we use higher rates in the lenders calculators.</description>

      <description>Great to see you have saved a significant deposit. The amount you can borrow is determined by your income and debt levels. As a first home buyer, you may also be eligible for First Home Owners Grant and exemptions from some government fees and charges. Being self-employed most lenders will require at least 2 years business financials. Would love to talk to you to gain a better understanding of your overall position and see how we can help you get into your own home.</description>

The house was valued at $850,000 and we need to get approval for $500,000. We already had gotten a pre-approval from RAMS but that was based on the fact I was on Newstart allowance and has now run out. Myself and my partner are now both on Carers payment and allowance and I know RAMS didn&#39;t recognise this as income. Who does recognise carers payments? and would approve this.</title>

      <description>There may be ways to work around the servicing of this issue. Primarily speaking there are lenders that look at carer&amp;rsquo;s allowance depending on the nature of it. Secondarily, it would be worthwhile to adjust perhaps your living situation for now if possible so that at least one of the properties can be used as an investment/rental. Let me know if you wish to explore this properly!</description>

      <description>Thanks for your question. Providing you have sufficient equity in your property, then you should be able to consolidate your unsecured debt into the home loan. Some lenders may restrict the loan term once you are above the age of 55 but others are a little more flexible in regards to this, particularly if you can show a clear exit strategy. Being self employed, you have various options open to you such as low doc, one year business financials or the last two years of business financials.</description>

      <description>With a 10% deposit you dont need genuine savings at all. However if you have to go above 90% then there are other options available, such as rental payments etc. With regards to valuation - did you go to a bank direct - because brokers have access to various panel valuers and could easily get a second valuation or challenge the low valuation by way of additional documentation like comparable sales etc.</description>

      <title>I am an Australian Citizen and my husband has just applied for his permanent residency based on 820/801 spouse visa. Currently he is on a Bridging Visa A that will take him towards the 820 visa [in a couple of months] and then the 801. We would like to apply for a home loan with 5% deposit if we can as we would like to start building a new home shortly. It will also be our first home and we do qualify for FHOG. Would it be possible to secure a home loan?</title>

      <description>As Ditte has suggested you can get a loan but we will need more detail to confirm the amount. I have done a very similar one recently and the question is not just whether the Bank will accept your husband as a borrower but also if they will accept his income. At 95% loan there are not too many that do but some will. I am more than happy to go over this with you and explain your options.</description>

      <description>What you would need to provide would be your Income - Expenses - Deposit (Equity or Family Guarantee). Income (all people who are borrowing) and details of what it is - salary - commission - family benefits etc. Expenses includes credit card limits, personal loans, car loans, HECS debt. Deposit - savings or any current property - any family member who can guarantee security so you dont need to save for a deposit.</description>

      <description>Generally lenders will require 5% of the total contract/purchase price as genuine savings. This means that it would need to be tracked back at least 3 months with a regular pattern rather than erratic lump sums. There are a few lenders who will accept rental history in leau of savings but the rental contract must be via a licensed real estate agent. The FHOG is not counted as genuine savings by lenders but is used at the drawdown of the construction loan to assist with the total cost.</description>

I am here to make that process as manageable and stress free as I can for you. I enjoy working with people and always strive to deliver the best possible experience and outcomes for my customer.</description>

Simone has over 13 years of experience in the finance industry including 10 years as a mortgage broker and 3 years working in a bank. There are a lot of products out there and searching the web/online is one way but still requires a lot of time and does not always give accurate information specific to an individual and can result in an application that does not proceed simply because it has not met the client?</description>
