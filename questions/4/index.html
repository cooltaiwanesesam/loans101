		<p> <p>While it is important to compare interest rates when looking for a home loan, it is just as important, if not more, to compare comparison rates. The idea behind comparison rates was to help borrowers understand how any fees or charges would impact an interest rate to help compare loans from different lenders by revealing the true cost of a loan.. Comparison rates are a handy tool but you need to understand how to use it and its limitations.</p>

<p>Remember, that just because a home loan has a low interest rate, it does not necessarily mean you will end up paying less overall. The comparison rate gives a more realistic view but just be careful of solely using it to help you decide which loan is the best one for you. Speak with your lender about their comparison rates to ensure you are getting the best deal for you.</p>

<p>With interest rates at their lowest for more than 50 years, there are some great rates available. The best thing to do is to compare rates from all the lenders. Let us help take the leg work out of doing this - <a href="http://loans101.com.au/compare/variable-rate-home-loan/">Compare Home Loans</a></p>
