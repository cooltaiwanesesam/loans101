                    We are happy to help people with bad credit. There are definitely lenders in the non conforming space who specialise in this area. The loan product and interest rates will depend on the type of &ldquo;bad credit&rdquo;, such as missed repayments, defaults or a high number credit enquiries. Based on this, we can match the most appropriate lender to your situation...

                    Based on the information you have provided there are a number of options that suit the criteria you have listed above. For a 5 year fixed rate with an offset account you could be looking at interest rates of about 4.19% right through to 4.79%. Some of these banks offer 100% offset accounts on their fixed rate loans and some will offer a shaded offset account, say around 50% to 70% offset...

If you are looking to build asap - the rent or board you are currently paying is not included in servicing if both loans are put in at the same time...

                    We can certainly assist in this type of project. Of course, the amount you can borrow will depend on your current financial position and the structure of ownership of these properties. You may also need to consider the taxation implications when subdividing blocks. Would love to have a chat to you about your situation so feel free to contact me through my profile...

                    This type of purchase would fall under a construction loan and is usually financed in two steps: buying the land then building the house. The loans can be arranged separately, but are generally bundled together for approval. The purchase of the land occurs as a standard mortgage. Then the building of the house operates as a construction loan where you can draw-down on an agreed amount to pay for each stage...

                    Assuming your transaction has been structured appropriately (bare trust considerations), there are many factors (some below) to consider with SMSF lending. There are a limited number of options offering up to 80% LVR meaning that your SMSF will need to contribute funds representing at least 20% of the valuation on completion, which in itself could pose a problem as valuations may come in less than contract price. There may also be liquidity requirements meaning that the SMSF must have sufficient cash assets (post-completion) as a buffer...

                    There are numerous lenders that can provide unsecured finance within 24-48 hours. I would suggest that you are best to book an appointment with a broker to undertake a review of your financial circumstances. You may have more options available to you than you are currently aware of, including unlocking equity from your home with an up-to-date valuation, consolidating debt and accessing existing lines of credit, along with many other options that include exploring the wide variety of competitive personal loan products on the market...

            I am a current home owner with a mortgage of $202,000. I am looking at re-financing my mortgage with lower repayments but would also like to burrow extra for minor house renovations. I don&#39;t have any other loans. I currently have a personal credit card with the credit limit of $9,000 (at the moment, my credit card debt is $500 as I don&#39;t really like using it unless it is for emergencies). I would like a loan that allows me to make extra repayments and have the ability to redraw if needed. I have been in my current job for 11months (started Oct 16) but can provide all necessary past financial documents if required. Please advise what the best option might be.

As a general rule of thumb, if you have had your current loan for more than 2 years, then it is likely that you will be able to refinance at a better rate and access some loan features such as a line of credit and a redraw facility...

                    Your lending options are unfortunately limited with a co-borrower that has an undischarged bankruptcy. You really require the assistance of a broker who specialises in credit impaired finance. Not all brokers are specialists in this area so choose someone who declares this speciality, particularly if your loan requirements are time sensitive. Good luck and I hope you achieve your dream home ownership!..

                    It sounds to me like you need a review of your financial circumstances to not only understand your borrowing power, but to also understand if a loan of this size will place you under financial distress. With 2 dependants, one being an infant, it is extremely important that you understand what loan amount you can afford, not necessary just what loan you can qualify for. With the Loan Value Ratio (LVR) you are looking at, you will likely be subject to Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) which will add to the total cost of your loan...

                    Are you saying you don&rsquo;t want to put in a deposit or you don&rsquo;t actually have any funds to put towards a deposit? Any lender is going to want to see that you have funds to complete the purchase, a deposit bond can assist if you don&rsquo;t have access to the funds right now but will have the funds prior to settlement, e.g using equity from another property via refinance/equity release...

                    Firstly, congratulations on embarking on the home loan journey. It is a very exciting time but I understand that issue of a default can be stressful. A small default like you describe won&rsquo;t necessarily stop you from getting a home loan approved, but there are things you can do to resolve it - as it is better to go in with a clean slate. Creditors will remove defaults if you can demonstrate they are wrong or you can make arrangements with them to pay it off...

                    This is indeed possible if you are happy to go jointly on the loan with your mother. You can still remain off the title. Unfortunately, there is no other way you will be able to refinance for her if you remain off the loan. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions...

                    You&rsquo;re a busy man I see with 5 kids so good on you. Just to answer your question, it&rsquo;s possible but you will need a really clean credit history as any loan you might take out will have to be approved by a Mortgage Insurer even after the lender says they will look at it. If you have a good rental payment history that helps and can be counted as genuine savings with certain lenders...

                    Equity in an international asset is not acceptable security for Australian lenders. However, another effective means of freeing up funds to reduce or eliminate LMI is a ground approach to your overall financial situation. By taking a wholistic approach to your financial requirements and delving deeper into your circumstances, we can ensure that all facets of your financial situation are performing optimally. If you are servicing debts such as cars, credit cards, personal loans that affect your ability to save effectively and efficiently, a simple financial health check could provide you with the means to better service your loan, save a greater deposit and place you in better overall financial position prior to applying for a home loan...

                    I assume that you are operating under the professional advice of your accountant or lawyer given you are looking to structure your loan under a trust. You most certainly need the assistance of a broker who can effectively liaise with your accountant or lawyer to ascertain the most appropriate product for your specific needs, goals and circumstances. Most brokers can secure you a competitive interest rate on your loan, however I suggest you find one that will delve a little deeper into your situation to ensure you are recommended a loan that provides you with the best value rather the lowest rate...

                    I am guessing that your situation has changed since you first took out the loan. Unfortunately I think you are going to struggle to refinance if you are not able to service the debt according the lenders calculators. As part of responsible lending obligations both mortgage brokers and lenders need to ensure that you can manage repayments should interest rates rise. This is why we use higher rates in the lenders calculators...

                    Great to see you have saved a significant deposit. The amount you can borrow is determined by your income and debt levels. As a first home buyer, you may also be eligible for First Home Owners Grant and exemptions from some government fees and charges. Being self-employed most lenders will require at least 2 years business financials. Would love to talk to you to gain a better understanding of your overall position and see how we can help you get into your own home...

            My partner (plus her mum, government job $62,000, her house valued at $500,000 and has $35,000 to pay plus $100,000 inheritance coming) and myself need to buy out her ex husbands share of the existing loan. The house was valued at $850,000 and we need to get approval for $500,000. We already had gotten a pre-approval from RAMS but that was based on the fact I was on Newstart allowance and has now run out. Myself and my partner are now both on Carers payment and allowance and I know RAMS didn&#39;t recognise this as income. Who does recognise carers payments? and would approve this.

                    There may be ways to work around the servicing of this issue. Primarily speaking there are lenders that look at carer&rsquo;s allowance depending on the nature of it. Secondarily, it would be worthwhile to adjust perhaps your living situation for now if possible so that at least one of the properties can be used as an investment/rental. Let me know if you wish to explore this properly!..

                    Thanks for your question. Providing you have sufficient equity in your property, then you should be able to consolidate your unsecured debt into the home loan. Some lenders may restrict the loan term once you are above the age of 55 but others are a little more flexible in regards to this, particularly if you can show a clear exit strategy. Being self employed, you have various options open to you such as low doc, one year business financials or the last two years of business financials...

                    With a 10% deposit you dont need genuine savings at all. However if you have to go above 90% then there are other options available, such as rental payments etc. With regards to valuation - did you go to a bank direct - because brokers have access to various panel valuers and could easily get a second valuation or challenge the low valuation by way of additional documentation like comparable sales etc...

I have done a very similar one recently and the question is not just whether the Bank will accept your husband as a borrower but also if they will accept his income. At 95% loan there are not too many that do but some will. I am more than happy to go over this with you and explain your options...

                    Generally lenders will require 5% of the total contract/purchase price as genuine savings. This means that it would need to be tracked back at least 3 months with a regular pattern rather than erratic lump sums. There are a few lenders who will accept rental history in leau of savings but the rental contract must be via a licensed real estate agent. The FHOG is not counted as genuine savings by lenders but is used at the drawdown of the construction loan to assist with the total cost...
