		<p> <p>I assume that you are operating under the professional advice of your accountant or lawyer given you are looking to structure your loan under a trust. You most certainly need the assistance of a broker who can effectively liaise with your accountant or lawyer to ascertain the most appropriate product for your specific needs, goals and circumstances. Most brokers can secure you a competitive interest rate on your loan, however I suggest you find one that will delve a little deeper into your situation to ensure you are recommended a loan that provides you with the best value rather the lowest rate. Interest rates are only one piece of the puzzle when working with complex loan structures and a thorough assessment of your overall situation is required to ensure you receive a loan tailored to your individual needs. Stokes &amp; Maker Financial Services is a boutique financial services broker focused on bespoke, individually tailored lending solutions and premium service. We are based in Brighton but can come to you to discuss your requirements. We do not charge our clients for any aspect of our services as all service related fees are charged to the lender. If you have yet to secure a broker to assist you, please get in contact for a confidential and obligation free discussion.</p>
