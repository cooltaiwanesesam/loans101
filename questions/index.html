                    Lending to self-employed borrowers can often be complex and requires extensive knowledge of a lender’s requirements. Thankfully some lenders provide more flexible options to suit a self-employed borrower’s differing circumstances.
As a self-employed borrower, you will most likely have to provide more information than the average borrower. This may include BAS statements, tax returns, bank statements or even a declaration from your accountant. If you are able to be quick when providing these items, it will help speed up the application process....

                    When a lender calculates your borrowing power, they look at your income and financial commitments and then calculate if you have enough money left over to afford the mortgage repayments. Some factors they look at include: income from your job, share investments, property investments and any family tax income. They look at financial commitments such as credit cards, other loans, other mortgages and HECS debt. They will also look at the total number of applicants and dependants to calculate your average living expenses....

                    There are plenty of factors to consider when choosing a lender and it’s important that you do plenty of research. Firstly, take a look at their product range. Not everyone is going to fit the same mold. You may have a different financial or personal situation to other borrowers, which will require a different home loan. Therefore, look for a lender who will offer a range of both specialised and prime home loan products to suit individual needs....

                    There are a number of myths floating around about refinancing and it is important to decipher fact from fiction before making any decisions. Here are a few myths we’ve busted.
Too costly to refinance: With exit fees being banned on 1 July 2011 (for loans established after this date), refinancing may not cost as much as you would think. Although there may be some fees included to switch lenders, if you find a lender who offers lower interest rates, little or no upfront fees or ongoing fees, you may find that you will receive greater savings over the life of the loan that outweigh these initial fees....
